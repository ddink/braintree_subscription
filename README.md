# Braintree Subscription

This is Rails application that integrates Braintree for the recurring billing of a customer by way of 
a subscription plan. While this app is a very bare-bones example of the many possibilities available 
with the Rails framework and a Braintree account, it illustrates some of the fundamentals of working with 
Braintree's modules.

I spent less than two hours putting together this application. It's fairly incomplete and does not illustrate how
to utilize all of Braintree's provided commerce functionality, but it would still serve as a good syntax reference for 
others with that in mind. You can run this application by cloning it, and running `bundle install`, 
`rake db:migrate`, and `rails server` in your terminal.
